## GamesFleadh 2019 Best Original Innovation by Nicholas Murray

## Introduction

This is my entry for the 2019 Games Fleadh Competition. Games Fleadh is an Irish national event for third level students to showcase their games to the community and to industry veterans.  
This game is a platformer with a bit of a twist, the twist is that the platforms are circular and the player gravitates towards the center of the platforms instead of vertically downward like traditional idea of gravity. There is also a mix of labyrinths and swarms of enemies to navigate around.
